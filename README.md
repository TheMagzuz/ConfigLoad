# ConfigLoad
A small library that I use to load config files. There are probably about a billion other libraries that do this better and faster, but  ¯\\_(ツ)_//¯

## File Formatting
Every file is formatted as such: 
```
# This is a comment!
# Notice the space between the "=" and the key
key = value
```
